# JetsonXavierNX
This repository holds the files needed to install the Jetson Xavier NX board after booting from a fresh flashed SD card.
It is assumed, that there is a SSD installed (or remove the last lines from the setup script)

external files used:
- nomachine_6.12.3_5_arm64.deb
- torch-1.5.0-cp36-cp36m-linux_aarch64.whl

noMachine is a tool to display the Jetson Xavier NX on a remote host, not vital to the operation of the xavier
Torch is the current wheel downloaded from NVIDIA (see https://elinux.org/Jetson_Zoo#PyTorch_.28Caffe2.29)
